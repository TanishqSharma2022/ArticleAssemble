These can cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream and reaching the body's tissues. Normal blood oxygen levels are above 95%, meaning 95% of haemoglobin is carrying oxygen, but if this value drops below 90%, it can be a sign of a deteriorating clinical state and mean that urgent medical attention is needed.</p><p>To monitor patients with respiratory conditions, doctors use a pulse-oximeter, a device that clips over and shines light through the fingertip. Haemoglobin-containing red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, absorb this light at a particular wavelength, which changes slightly according to how much oxygen is present. Less oxygen alters the level of light absorption, which the device can measure.</p><p>Smartphones equipped with cameras are also able to measure light of different wavelengths. \"Your phone is designed for photography. So, the camera will measure light at red, green and blue wavelengths,\" explains Hoffman. And although the wavelengths picked up by a phone camera are not necessarily those used in a pulse oximeter, \"your phone can simulate what a pulse oximeter does.\"</p><p>This is because smartphone cameras can actually measure more wavelengths of light than a pulse oximeter. As a result, they can detect light reflected from cells other than blood cells in your finger, such as skin, muscle and fat.\u00a0 Much of the light detected will be from these other cells rather than oxygen-carrying red blood cells, which presents a problem: how to tell what light absorption is down to the red blood cells alone.</p><p>Scientists have solved this problem using a technique known as machine learning. Machine learning involves feeding a computer large sets of data with the intention of training it to search for patterns that are hard to spot by eye. By learning these patterns, the computer will be able to connect them to a particular outcome.</p><p>Hoffman and his colleagues have used machine learning to uncover a pattern that can accurately determine how much of the light detected by a smartphone camera is actually attributable to the red blood cells alone. As a result, they are able to calculate how much oxygen is present in the blood right down to 70% saturation levels - the lowest value pulse oximeters need to measure as set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\u00a0</p><p>\"No one has shown that you can measure blood oxygen levels with a smartphone accurately down to 70%. So we're pretty optimistic about trying to test on a larger group of people in the future,\" says Hoffman.</p><p>Ensuring that this computer \"machine-learned\" pattern works for a diverse group of people who will want to use the application is critical though. \"The next step is to test on people with a variety of skin tones and skin aberrations so that we can validate whether the app works on a wider range of people,\" Hoffman explains.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00665-y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Smartphone camera oximetry in an induced hypoxemia study</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>A fabric capable of tuning in to the sounds around it has been developed at Massachussets Institue of Technology (MIT).</strong></p><p>Flat fabric can ripple with waves when exposed to sound, much like the surface of water.

Fabrics are deeply connected to our everyday lives, from the clothes off our backs to upholstery and other home comforts.

When a pressure wave hits a fabric, it causes ripples in the fabric. But these are too small for us to feel or see.\u00a0</p><p>Taking inspiration from a human ear where fibres play important roles in converting pressure waves to electrical signals, the team from MIT developed a fibre to help detect sound ripples in a fabric.</p><p>The fibre needs to be flexible in order to bend with the sound waves created in the fabric. In addition, the fibre needs to produce electrical signals when bent to collect the sounds. To do this, they encapsulated a piezoelectric material in a rubbery material. Piezoelectric (from Greek piezein - to squeeze) is a materials property that means when the matrial is deformed, it creates an electric charge in the material.</p><p>The fibre is then woven into a piece of fabric. The researchers were able to demonstrate that their fabric can detect sounds such as clapping. They can even detect which direction the sound came from if multiple fibres are used.\u00a0</p><p>Not only is the fabric functional, they also ensured that the fibre was easy to manufacture. The functional fabric still behaved like a fabric and is even machine washable. This means the technology is viable for mass production and can eventually become ubiquitous.</p><p>According to Fink, a four-step approach to a future of functional fabrics is needed, comprising fibres with specific functions and properties such as piezoelectrics or fibre batteries; combining the fibres into a fabric; translating the electrical signals collected by the fabric into useful information, such as a human voice and words; and designing \"apps\" to utilise the functionalites. For example, being able to pick up sounds clearly if you are in a noisy environment, or listening to the heartbeat of a fetus if you are pregnant.</p><p>The possibilities are endless, he says.\u00a0</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04476-9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Yan et al.

Unlike traditional clocks, which use pendulums and springs, or digital clocks that use the vibrations of a piece of quartz, atomic clocks use the energy levels of atoms to slice up time. In a similar idea to a pendulum, electrons around these atoms click between two energy states. By fine tuning a laser, scientists can probe the natural \"swing time\" between these two states. Since that swing time is constant: dictated by the rules of quantum mechanics, this lets us measure the passage of time.</p><p>This is what Prof Jun Ye and his team at the University of Colorado are doing. But instead of building one atomic clock, they are making many in the same machine. Their device comprises layers of strontium atoms, like a stack of pancakes, and interrogates each layer individually.\u00a0 Because the layers are arranged vertically, those closer to the Earth should tick slower than those higher up.\u00a0 And indeed, that is what the scientists see.</p><p>The really astonishing fact is how precisely the team are able to measure this difference. The layers of atoms are less than 1mm apart, meaning that we can measure the effect of gravity on the dilation of time at microscopic spatial resolution. To give an idea of how precise this is, the bottom of the stack loses 0.0000000000000000001 seconds for every second the top clock clicks.\u00a0 If this experiment were to have been started at the Big Bang, it would have lost less than a tenth of a second by now.</p><p>Measuring gravity on such a fine scale opens many doors. Ye is hopeful that this technology could be used to detect magma flows and predict volcanoes, help us navigate to Mars, or even probe the mystery of dark matter.</p><p>But perhaps more exciting is that with a push to build clocks which are a hundred times more accurate than this (which Ye thinks might be possible in the next decade), we may be able to measure the interaction of gravity and quantum mechanics. At this scale, atoms start to behave more like waves but currently we don't have a good understanding of what happens when part of this wave is in a stronger gravitational field than another. Prof Ye hopes that we will start to be able to probe the intersection of gravity and quantum mechanics through measuring time.</p><p>For all the potential applications, it is still an impressive engineering feat. Technologies from disparate parts of science have consolidated in this laboritory to measure how Earth distorts time itself on the smallest of scales.

This is because the mass of the fused atom is lower than the sum of the masses of the original atoms: the resulting difference is emitted as energy. The problem is that merging atoms together is very difficult. When they come close, their positively charged nuclei repel each other. The only place in the whole Universe where there is enough pressure for fusion to occur is at the centre of stars like our Sun.</p><p>Or at least, that was the case until about 70 years ago, when scientists figured out how to make hydrogen atoms fuse, here on Earth. At the LLNL, scientists use a technique called \u2018inertial confinement fusion\u2019. There are few scientific experiments in the world more awe-inspiring than this. The hydrogen atoms, which the researchers call the fuel, are frozen inside a spherical capsule as big as a grain of sand. The capsule is made of a material similar to diamond, which is the hardest material on the planet. Around this capsule is a hollow cylinder made entirely of gold. This is about 1 cm long and sits at the centre of a 10-meter wide aluminium sphere that is covered in sensors to detect the energy coming out during fusion.</p><p>So far so good, but how do you get the atoms to fuse? Well, you need to press them together very vigorously, usually at extremely high temperatures. To do that, scientists use the biggest laser in the world, called the National Ignition Facility. It's as large as three American football fields, and shoots 192 laser beams straight at the diamond capsule: 96 of them enter the top of the cylinder, 96 enter the bottom. The golden cylinder acts as an x-ray oven, transforming the laser light into thermal x-rays which heat up the capsule so much that it explodes. At that stage, the capsule becomes a sort of spherical rocket: its explosion generates an equal and opposite force that makes the fuel inside it implode.</p><p>Because the energy required to achieve this is very high, usually scientists make the capsule small. \"But this time we made the capsule larger, and although the laser power remained the same, we managed to achieve fusion, which resulted in higher energy than previously measured,\" says Callahan. \"What we need now is more laser energy, and our team is working on that as well as on other aspects of the engineering design to achieve even higher energy yields\".</p><p>The amount of energy released during fusion was 1.3 megajoules, which converts to about 300 kcal, or the energy of a candy bar. This may not sound like a lot, but it was released in an extremely short amount of time (a fraction of a second), which makes the power burst more similar to the power a space rocket develops when taking off.</p><p>\u201cWe have made a lot of progress over the last decade, and this result shows we are going in the right direction,\u201d concludes Callahan.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>A technique to transfer data at superfast speeds using sound and light has been developed by UK researchers...</strong></p><p>This new breakthrough involves sending a sound wave through a quantum cascade laser to achieve wireless data transfer rates of 100 gigabytes per second. At speeds like this, you could download tens of movies in less than the time it takes to say \"Amazon Prime\".</p><p>The approach is one of the first successful demonstrations of creating and using high frequency terahertz waves. This range of frequencies is famously referred to as the \u201cterahertz gap\u201d, because limitations in existing technologies hampered our abilities to make use of these frequencies in the past.</p><p>To create sufficiently short waves at such high frequencies, the source needs to be switched on and off very quickly. This process is called modulation. Most WiFi and mobile devices, including Bluetooth, cordless phones and your car keys, operate at a frequency of 2.4GHz. This is the same range used for microwave ovens, and it was adopted for these newer applications precisely because the required technology was already well developed. An additional benefit is that these frequencies do not interfere with the signals used for radio and TV transmissions.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>But as more devices seek to exploit this space as the \"Internet of things\" takes off, the\u00a02.4GHz bandwidth is getting crowded, which is degrading performance and hence user experience.</p><p>The much-hyped 5G network partially surmounts this problem by operating at higher 30 and 300GHz frequencies. At the moment, very few devices operate in those bandwidths, meaning that the airwaves are less crowded and there's plenty of electronmagnetic elbow room for new sensors and devices.</p><p>That's fine for the time being, but once we all start communicating with 3D holograms, watching live sports games in virtual reality, and streaming 8K movies, we'll become starved of bandwidth again.</p><p>This is where Nottingham University's Tony Kent thinks he can make a difference with a new approach that uses a terahertz quantum cascade laser to \u201cmodulate\u201d a light pulse fast enough to reach terahertz frequencies.</p><p>In an experimental setup, Kent's team have managed to create 100 billion light pulses per second by propagating a sound wave we cannot hear through the laser.</p><p>To understand how it works, think of the cascade laser as a staircase with hundreds of steps. The wave is created by releasing an electron, which loses energy every time it drops down one of these steps. As it does so, the electron emits a photon, which is a quantum of light. The size of each step corresponds to a wavelength in the terahertz range. To make it lose energy sufficiently quickly, the researchers sent a sound wave through the laser. This shook up the whole cascade, creating the terahertz wave.</p><p>The device they used here was the size of a few millimetres, but it could be engineered to be small enough to fit into devices. But because they are so close in frequency to visible light, terahertz waves are also very susceptible to obstacles in their paths, just as we cannot see through walls. So this new technique would mostly be for point-to-point, short range data transfers. This means transmitters would need to be positioned in any locations where ultrafast data transfer is desired, but it would be particularly useful in spaces where there are no obstructions.</p><p>So there you go, next time you wonder what will happen after 5G, think terahertz cascade quantum laser transmission!</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14662-w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">High-speed modulation of a terahertz quantum cascade laser by coherent acoustic phonon pulses</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>A new display that uses high-frequency sound waves to move an illuminated ball 'pixel' and build a convincing 3D image has been announced by UK and Japanese researchers...</strong></p><p>This technology may sound like something straight out of science fiction, but the new display technology, announced in the latest edition of the journal Nature, brings us closer to three-dimensional imaging systems that, crucially, don't require the use of special glasses or additional bulky equipment.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>The new display uses ultrasound waves, which are at frequency far beyond what a human can hear, to trap a small, illuminated ball in place and then move it at high speeds to trace out an image.</p><p>Because the ball moves faster than the human eye can discern, the result is a persistent 3D image, in colour.\u00a0</p><p>The display is about the same size and shape as a microwave with the door removed; inside is where the magic happens.

There is an enormous need for humankind in improved methods of refrigeration since so much of global electrical energy is consumed by refrigeration.\u201d</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>A fridge that relies on twist wouldn\u2019t need to be very big either: a prototype built by the team uses twisted fibres immersed in water; a compact simple motor rotates one end of the fibres in alternating directions. Elastocaloric fridges, in contrast, would need a larger amount of space to fit the stretch and release cycle.</p><p>Moreover, the twistocaloric fridge was able to achieve about 67% efficiency, which, when compared to that of existing commercial fridges - usually around 60% - is a significant improvement.</p><p>In another experiment, the researchers varied the direction in which the fibres were twisted and then coiled into a spring. The direction in which they\u2019re twisted is called chirality, or handedness. By twisting a fibre to maximal twist, and then continuing to coil it in the same direction, we can get a \u201chomochiral\u201d fibre. And if we stretch a homochiral fishing line fibre for example, the cooling that the researchers measured was 50 times higher than if they had just stretched an untwisted fibre.</p><p>An even stranger effect happens if we twist in one direction, say clockwise, and then coil the twisted fibre in the opposite direction, or counterclockwise. In this case, the cooling and heating effects of the stretching cycle are now reversed! Stretching cools it down, and releasing heats it up. For these kinds of heterochiral fibres, stretching actually causes an untwisting of the initial fibre, which then has a cooling effect.</p><p>\u201cThe materials that we investigated here can cool down by as much as 20 degrees just by releasing stretch from them when they\u2019re coiled,\u201d says Ray Baughman. And the materials that they used were off the shelf rubber bands, polyethylene fishing line and NiTi wires. Other materials could have even higher cooling potential, or new materials could be purposely developed to increase this cooling effect.</p><p>Behind the cooling and heating effects of stretching or twisting fibres is entropy. In a stretched or twisted state, the long molecules in the materials being studied were more orderly aligned than in a relaxed state, and so they were at lower entropy. And it\u2019s this switching from low entropy to high entropy that causes cooling, and then heating when done in reverse.</p><p>This research provides an alternative refrigeration technology that has the potential to be more efficient and also more environmentally friendly. With the increased concern for climate change and the problems caused by refrigerant gases being released into the atmosphere from devices such as fridges and air conditioning, more sustainable options are needed soon.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aax6182\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Torsional refrigeration by twisted, coiled, and supercoiled fibers</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>Scientists have found a material which could lead us to having less flammable batteries...</strong></p><p>Rechargeable lithium ion batteries have been known to catch fire, and this is because of the highly flammable liquid electrolyte within. Replacing this with a less flammable material would make the batteries much safer. Now scientists at the University of Louvain, in Belgium, have found a new alloy, which might just do the trick.</p><p>The electrolyte is the part of the battery which separates the negative terminal - the cathode - from the positive anode. When a battery discharges, negatively-charged electrons flow from the cathode, around the circuit, and back into the anode. To recharge the battery, the electrons are pushed back from the anode into cathode, travelling through the electrolyte inside the battery as they go.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>\u201cA defect in manufacturing, or an external shock, can put the anode and the cathode in contact. Then a lot of heat can be released,\u201d explains Geoffroy Hautier, author of the study. Heat, combined with oxygen in the air and a potential fuel means a fire can start. Typically, the electrolyte is made up of an organic liquid, which is very flammable.</p><p>Liquids are more flammable than solids, as the molecules have more surface area to react with oxygen in the air, which is needed for something to burn. \u201cOne thing battery researchers have been trying for some time now, is to replace this liquid electrolyte with a solid; this would be much safer,\u201d says Hautier.</p><p>Electrolytes are made of organic liquids, so that the lithium ions to power the battery can be pushed through quickly. But finding a solid material, which will let lithium ions flow through quickly enough to be practical has proved to be a challenge. Solids are made of rigid lattice structures with all the atoms held firmly in place, making any movement difficult. Now, Hautier and his team have developed a new alloy, which is a solid but lets lithium flow through easily.</p><p>\u201cThis material we\u2019ve found is basically around 10 times higher in this diffusion coefficient - this mobility of lithium - then the best, previously-known solid,\u201d says Hautier. The diffusion coefficient is a measure of how quickly something can flow through a material - like how fast a drop of ink can diffuse into a glass of water.</p><p>The new alloy is made up of a combination of lithium, titanium, phosphorus and sulphur and works by having a \u201cfrustrated\u201d lattice structure. The lithium ions in this structure are not fixed to lattice sites and are constantly moving around. This means that, with some external \u201cpush\u201d from a battery charger, the ions can flow through the solid.</p><p>One of the shortcomings of this new alloy is that it contains titanium, which is not very stable. Hautier hopes to be able to replace this in due course with zirconium, which will result in a more stable alloy. But the most important finding for him is the discovery of this new type of crystal structure in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWe understood why this material is so good. We understood what in the crystal structure makes the lithium so mobile. Now, with this understanding, we can go back to other materials and maybe try to find materials with the same types of properties which haven\u2019t been looked at yet.\u201d</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451929419303092?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Superionic Diffusion through Frustrated Energy Landscape</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>Unfortunately, ET and his friends have not come for a visit: scientists say that\u00a0alien technology is not behind solar system newcomer Oumuamua...</strong></p><p>First spotted on 19 October 2017 by\u00a0astronomer Robert Weryk using the Hawaii-based Pan-STARRS telescope, the object was reported to be between 100 and 1,000 metres long and over 150 metres at the widest point. Bizarrely, it was also accelerating on its course and its high velocity relative to the Sun meant that an origin within the Solar System was very unlikely. As a nod to its extra-solar origins, and speculation that perhaps this was an alien spacecraft, it was given the name 'Oumuamua', which means 'scout' in Hawaiian.</p><p>But this week, the journey for this ET came to an end. Writing in\u00a0the journal Nature Astronomy,\u00a0a team of 14 scientists have scrutinised the observations of Oumuamua and reached the slightly disappointing conclusion that this is definitely not an alien. In their paper, each trait of Oumuamua\u2019s flyby that raised alien suspicions has been explained as a natural phenomenon. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think this is artificial, everything we observed can be explained by it being a natural object,\u201d comments Alan Fitzsimmons, co-author and professor of Astronomy at Queen's University Belfast.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>The detection of interstellar objects has been anticipated for decades now, yet Oumuamua was able to stump the science community for years. When first observed, the object seemed to have a brightness signature that resembled that of an elongated ship. When looking back at the data though, the team found that significant variations in brightness signatures also show that this object would have been tumbling over multiple axes. So any aliens aboard would have to be very resilient to vomiting if they wanted to survive their trip!</p><p>\u201cIf it was an alien spaceship, it\u2019d be pretty much out of control,\u201d says Fitzimmons.</p><p>Another troubling issue was the object\u2019s non-gravitational acceleration, which led some to believe that Oumuamua was actually a solar sail, a device that relies on a star\u2019s sunlight to propel it forward. The team found that this \u2018artificial\u2019 acceleration is seen naturally from\u00a0 objects such as comets. Comets are icy rocks and when the sun\u2019s intense rays hit their ice, gas is released that can propel the object in the opposite direction. From the team's data, it is not 100% clear whether Oumuamua had sufficient ice for this propulsion, but that is due to restrictions in telescope sensitivity.</p><p>\u201cWe have to remember that Oumuamua - at its brightest - was a pretty faint object that you needed a very large telescope to detect clearly,\u201d Fitzsimmons points out.\u00a0Despite not having sensitive enough equipment, the team found that it is more than possible that Oumuamua had these gas emissions.</p><p>Now that astronomers have had the chance to record the first-ever interstellar object from outside our solar system, future sightings can be improved upon greatly. In just three years time, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in Chile will be able to increase our detection rate from 1 every 10 years to 1 every year. On top of that, the Comet Interceptor mission has been approved and could be active as early as 2028. The mission will put a probe in orbit just past the moon and it will have the ability to intercept any visitors that wander close enough.</p><p>\u201cIt may be that within the next 15 years we even get a close-up view of one of these natural objects from another planetary system,\u201d says Fitzsimmons. \u201cWhich will be incredibly exciting...\u201d</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0816-x\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The natural history of \u2018Oumuamua</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>Everyone\u2019s favourite autonomous submarine vehicle, Boaty McBoatface, has helped scientists decipher a mystery in the Southern Ocean\u2026</strong></p><p>Temperatures at the seafloors of the world's oceans have been rising over the past few decades, which has implications for rising sea levels.

Increased wind speeds intensify turbulence deep within the Southern Ocean, causing warm water at mid depths to mix with cold, dense water from below. The water that sinks in the Antarctic then ripples around the world.</p><p>Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato from the University of Southampton sent Boaty on a mission to explore an underwater valley off the Antarctic coast. Boaty was able to take measurements of temperature, salinity and turbulence down to within 50 metres of the valley floor.</p><p>Garabato explains turbulence as \u201cwhat you feel when you are in a plane flying over a mountain range and it gets all bumpy. The same kind of thing happens in the ocean as the water flows over submarine mountains.\u201d The strong winds above the Southern Ocean accelerate the currents in the water and, as the faster currents flow over the submarine mountains and valleys, they generate more turbulence. This leads to mixing between the different layers of the ocean, which are naturally at different temperatures, just like when you stir cold milk into your hot cup of tea.</p><p>The winds blowing over the Southern Ocean have been getting stronger due to the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Both the ozone layer and greenhouse gases are able to trap solar warming. Atmospheric temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere due to rising levels of greenhouse gases, but there is less solar warming above the Antarctic due to depleted levels of atmospheric ozone. Gas at different temperatures has different pressure, so there is lower pressure air above the Antarctic. This pressure gradient is driving the strong winds in Antarctica.</p><p>Consequently, temperatures at the bottom of the ocean have risen by between 0.03\u00b0C and 0.1\u00b0C across the world since the 1990s. While that might not sound like a lot, Garabato says that \u201cbecause the volume of this body of water is very large, it actually represents a big chunk of heat. The latest estimates suggest that about 30% of all the ocean warming has happened in this very bottom layer.\u201d</p><p>This research shows that, for scientists modeling the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on rising sea levels, it is not enough to only consider rising atmospheric temperatures. The added mechanism of increasing greenhouse emissions strengthening the winds above the Southern Ocean, leading to a global increase in temperatures at the sea bottom, means that sea levels could rise even faster than previously predicted.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://institutions.newscientist.com/article/dn16740-global-warming-reaches-the-antarctic-abyss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Increasing seabed temperatures</a></div><div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"https://institutions.newscientist.com/article/dn25547-antarctic-wind-vortex-is-strongest-for-1000-years/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Increasing Antarctic winds</a></div><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/06/17/1904087116\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rapid mixing and exchange of deep-ocean waters in an abyssal boundary current</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>The structure of a class of exotic particles, called pentaquarks, is being revealed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider...</strong></p><p>Quarks are sub-atomic particles that combine together to form the components from which the atoms that make up the matter around us are themselves made. Indeed, as Tomasz Skwarnicki of Syracuse University points out, \u201cwe are made out of quarks!\u201d Break up an atom, and you\u2019ll find them inside.</p><p>Physicists knew from previous experiments that quarks usually assemble into groups of three to produce familiar particles like protons and neutrons - also known as baryons - from which atoms are made. They can also make more exotic particles called \u201cmesons\u201d, which are combinations of just two quarks.</p><p>But, in 2015, with an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider called LHCb, Skwarnicki and his collaborators found evidence for particles composed of assemblages not of two or three quarks, but five. For obvious reasons, these are dubbed \"pentaquarks\". But although there was evidence for their existence, the physical structure of the pentaquark wasn't known and was a subject of significant debate among theoreticians.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>Many of the models were conflicting and disagreed on the sub-structure of the peculiar particles.\u00a0\u201cThere were a lot of theoretical papers published, which proposed different models of pentaquarks,\u201d explains\u00a0Skwarnicki.</p><p>The new study reveals that, rather than being composed of five quarks bonded tightly, and directly, to each other in a so-called \u201ctightly bound\u201d or \u201ccompact pentaquark\u201d model, pentaquarks are instead composed of two smaller structures: one contains three quarks, and its partner the other two. The two sub-particles are bonded weakly to each other in what is known as the \u201cmolecular model\u201d.</p><p>This molecular model of the pentaquark looks remarkably like a baryon (three quarks) and a meson (two quarks) linked loosely together, quite similar to the way atoms join together to form molecules. \u201cThis is why we call [these kinds of models] molecular models,\u201d says\u00a0Skwarnicki.</p><p>The team were able to distinguish between the models for two key reasons. First, they found that pentaquarks had long lifetimes, which meant there must be some mechanism to make the particles stable. The molecular model provides this, whereas the tightly-bound model does not.</p><p>Additionally, the team discovered a new pentaquark particle, but found that its mass was lower than previously-identified pentaquarks; this also \u201cpoints in the same direction of the molecular model,\u201d they say.</p><p>This new understanding has big implications for particle physics, because it will help scientists to predict what kinds of new particles to look for in experiments at the LHC and elsewhere in the future, although Skwarnicki concedes that this work has little practical impact on our day to day lives at the moment. That said, as he points out, \"you never know where some discoveries today might impact technologies of the future!\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the work will also inform the world of astrophysics. Neutron stars, which are massive cosmic structures composed of trillions upon trillions (about 10<sup>57</sup>) of neutrons, are essentially gigantic clumps of quarks. Skwarnicki believes a deeper understanding of quark structures \u201ccould change astrophysical models of these objects.\u201d</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>Nanoparticles that can be injected into the eye to endow the retina with infrared vision have been developed by scientists in China...</strong></p><p>Invisible to the naked eye, infrared light is nevertheless felt as heat, and we can see it with the aid of special infrared-sensitive cameras.</p><p>But now a\u00a0team led by Yuqian Ma, from the University of Science and Technology of China, have created a new technology that gives mice 10 weeks of infrared vision with little side-effects.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>\u201cIn order to see infrared light, it must first be converted to visible light,\u201d explains Tijmen Euser, from the Nanophotonics centre at the University of Cambridge, who is not an author of the work. \u201cThey applied nanoparticles that are able to absorb infrared light and convert it to visible light [then] they have injected these nanoparticles into the mice eyes and have shown that the mice can, indeed, see infrared light.\u201d</p><p>The process spans the fields of physics, chemistry and biology.

Crucially, the mice were trained using shapes displayed in visible light. Then the team switched to showing the shapes only in infrared and the animals continued to respond, proving that they could still see the presented shapes.</p><p>The possibilities arising from this research are many and varied, including treatment of some vision impairments, development of enhanced human vision for military applications, and human-machine interactions.</p><p>According to the study's co-author Tian Xue, \"we believe this technology will also work in human eyes, not only for generating 'super-vision' but also for therapeutic solutions in human red colour vision deficits.

But several diseases might be the result of small changes at the single cell level.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>A cell is a complex system and as Alex Ivanov, a researcher from Imperial College London, says, \u201ca lot of biological processes happen at very low concentrations.\u201d Some of the important molecules inside a cell exist in such small quantities that they are difficult to detect. Traditionally, cells are burst open to reveal their contents. However, this destroys the cells and a lot of important information, like the location of molecules within the cell and how a cell changes over time, is lost.</p><p>To overcome these challenges researchers have developed a new tool called \u2018nano-tweezers\u2019, which was announced this week in a study published in the journal <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em>. These miniscule devices are minimally invasive and can pick out individual molecules from specific locations inside the cell. \u201cWhat is important here is that we can extract single entities, one at a time, and the cell remains alive,\u201d says Joshua Edel, another author of this study.</p><p>The \u2018nano-tweezers\u2019 are about 100,000 times smaller than the tweezers you might find in your bathroom. They are formed from a glass rod, which is heated and snapped to create a sharp tip with two hollow chambers. The chambers are filled with a carbon-based material much like graphite to create two tiny electrodes separated by a small distance.</p><p>\u201cIt is a little bit like a pencil,\u201d explains Ivanov. \u201cIt\u2019s filled with graphite and the glass envelope outside is similar to the wood you have on a pencil. The only difference here is that you have two channels where the graphite goes and they are separated by a small gap and this is where we generate the electric field which traps the molecules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe technique relies on a method called dielectrophoresis,\u201d adds Edel. \u201cIf you take a particle - it could be a piece of DNA for example, or a protein - and you expose it to a non-uniform electric field between these two electrodes, you generate a very high trapping force and it\u2019s this very high trapping force which enables us to extract single molecules from the cell.\u201d</p><p>In addition to extracting molecules from cells, the \u2018nano-tweezers\u2019 can also be used in reverse, meaning that things can be delivered into the cell. Therefore this new technique can be used to study living cells and in particular it will enable scientists to study what happens to cells when components are added, removed or rearranged inside them. This offers exciting potential to better understand how healthy cells function and what goes wrong in diseased cells.</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41565-018-0315-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nanoscale tweezers for single-cell biopsies</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>As a galaxy in the early universe feeds off its smaller neighbours, the energy released from the massive influx of material creates the brightest light known in the Universe...</strong></p><p>The brightest lights in our universe are called quasars and as Dr George Lansbury, from the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge explains, \"what you have there is a supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy and material within the galaxy, so gas, dust and stars, is plummeting towards that supermassive black hole.\"</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>This releases a huge amount of energy, which is observed as an exceptionally bright source of light.

Hilbert thought the problem so difficult and important, he is noted to have said: <em>\u201cIf I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: has the Riemann Hypothesis been proven?\u201d</em></p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>A solution for the Riemann Hypothesis also happens to be what Russell Crowe\u2019s character tries to present a solution of in \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d. The problem surrounds the fact that no one can predict what the next prime number will be, as they do not follow a known distribution pattern. The initial suggestion for a mathematical solution to this issue was proposed by Riemann in 1859, and has in fact been checked for a great deal of prime numbers. Though it has so far proved to be correct for those, the hypothesis has not yet been proved to work for all possible prime numbers.</p><p>Additionally, the largest prime number known already has 23,249,425 digits. That\u2019s not a typo; it really has over 23 million digits. So why do we need to know more about primes when we already know so many, and the largest is almost inconceivably long?</p><p>Well prime numbers have an important part to play in both pure mathematics and applied fields, particularly in data encryption. To protect our data but still allow people to message us, a public key is given out freely, which is a very large number, and this is used to encrypt or \u201clock\u201d the information. This very large number is actually the multiplication of two large prime numbers, which together are known as the private key. No one else has these two numbers, and they are then used to decrypt or \u201cunlock\u201d the message once received; attempting to use any other numbers would result in gibberish.</p><p>So is Atiyah\u2019s proof correct? Well this will be the really tricky part. The proof he presents is based upon as yet unpublished work on something called the Todd function, an equation developed in theoretical physics.

Impressive as this is, jazzing up graphene to introduce additional properties is not straightforward or scalable.</p><p>So scientists are on a quest for the next new material with even more exciting properties. A recent contender is a class of compounds called MOFs, short for metal organic frameworks.

This means that today, 410 particles out of every 1 million air particles in Earth\u2019s atmosphere are carbon dioxide, or 0.041%. The presence of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the Earth, and is linked to climate change. In fact, the average global temperature has risen by 0.8\u00baC since 1880.</p><p>One of the biggest contributors of carbon dioxide emissions is the burning of fossil fuels, much of it to power vehicles and heat homes. A possible solution to lowering carbon dioxide emissions would be to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, like solar or wind power. Whether it is possible, though, for 100% of the World\u2019s energy to come from such sources is a subject of fierce debate.</p><p><div class=\"block-inject block-inject-1\" id=\"block-inject-1\" style=\"float: left;\"><section class=\"block block-block clearfix\" id=\"block-block-25\"><div style=\"width: 160px; margin: 15px;\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></section></div><p>In an earlier analysis<sup>1</sup>, researchers at the University of Adelaide, Australia, led by Benjamin Heard, looked at a series of 100% renewable energy scenarios to assess their feasibility. Although, as Heard points out, \u201cwe looked only at whether the proposed systems were physically capable of working, we didn\u2019t explore whether they could be delivered within the social, political, and economical constraints of society.\"</p><p>The findings of the Australian study were that a \"100% renewable electricity supply would, at the very least, demand a reinvention of the entire electricity supply-and-demand system to enable renewable supplies to approach the reliability of current systems.\" In a nutshell, with today's technology, an entirely renewable energy supply is not on the cards.</p><p>Currently, renewable sources account for only about 25% of the world's energy consumption, which is also set to rise by 28% by the year 2040. That means renewable energy production would have to increase by over 80% in the next 22 years to keep pace with the world's projected rising energy demand. But is this realistic on a global scale? Certainly some countries and regions have already reached 100% renewable energy, but they tend to be small and are often special cases.</p><p>One well-known 100% renewable energy model is the country of Iceland. Iceland runs primarily on geothermal and hydropower. But Heard and his team point out that Iceland\u2019s energy model cannot be applied to other countries due to its \u201cunique endowment of shallow geothermal aquifers, abundant hydropower, and a population of only 0.3 million people.\u201d But does this mean that 100% renewable energy is possible only for countries with an abundance of natural resources?</p><p>Now a team at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, in Germany, lead by Tom Brown, has revisited the Australian study and are more upbeat about the prognosis<sup>2</sup>. \u201cYou can fill the gaps when the sun isn\u2019t shining and the wind isn\u2019t blowing with hydroelectricity,\u201d explains Brown. \"Or [for example] there is a power line between the Netherlands and Great Britain, so when the wind isn\u2019t blowing in Great Britain you can import [the energy] from Holland and vice versa. And finally, there\u2019s storage. You can store energy when there\u2019s lots of wind and solar, and can feed it back into the grid when there isn\u2019t so much [wind and solar].\"</p><p>According to the German team, \"100% renewable energy scenarios proposed in the literature are not just feasible, but also viable.\" And rather than a reinvention of the electricity supply-and-demand system, \"only a directed evolution of the current system is required to guarantee affordability, reliability and sustainability.\"</p><p>One thing experts can definitely agree on is the urgency of this issue.\u00a0\u201cPeople need to know how urgent this is. Now is the time for action,\" explains Brown. And according to\u00a0 Heard,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve spent 30 years talking about global warming, and we\u2019ve been misunderstanding the scale of this problem. We need a massive reset on our approach if we want to make the next 30 years different.\"</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117304495\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">1.

Until the recent rainfall which ended a drought in Cape Town, South Africa, the government there had been desperately planning for Day Zero: the day when the city's water supply would run dry. So knowing where the fresh water is, and where it's going, is enormously important when planning for the future.</p><p>Now, using data gathered by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Satellite (GRACE) from 2002 to 2016, a team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre were able to measure trends in the amount of freshwater in any particular region, once they had accounted for the change caused by the seasons.</p><p>\"We found eight were associated with climate change, 14 associated with direct human impact, water management in particular and groundwater pumping and only 12 of them were caused by natural variability alone,\" says Chief of the Hydrological Science Laboratory at NASA Goddard, Matthew Rodell.\u00a0</p><p>GRACE is a unique satellite system for two reasons.

The increases in freshwater were likely caused by snow accumulation, whereas the losses were likely due to the impact of climate change.</p><p>The cause of these changes in the amount of freshwater has a variety of causes. Many are caused by, or likely to have been caused by climate change. There were, however, several other factors. An increase of freshwater in Eastern China was likely due to the filling of the Three Gorges Dam, and other reservoirs.</p><p>By looking at how much any trend looks like a straight line on a graph, also called its \u201ccoefficient of determination\u201d, the team were able to make inferences about how lasting, or temporary, any trend might be.</p><p>\"People are somewhat addicted to groundwater use for irrigating agriculture, so it would take a substantial change, perhaps a policy change or a great improvement in water use efficiency in order for those trends to diminish,\"\u00a0explains Rodell.</p><p>An understanding of this model and an awareness of freshwater availability across the globe is vitally important. The knowledge that a place may be running out of freshwater will help local governments plan for their future.</p><p>Commenting on the results, which are published in the journal Nature, Rodell emphasises the crucial importance of water to human existence, pointing out that \"it's critical we have an understanding of how freshwater availability is changing and this is the first time we really have a global map of how those changes have been occurring.\"</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-field-references\"><h2 class=\"pane-title\"> References</h2><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-field-references field-type-link-field field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0123-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Emerging trends in global freshwater availability</a></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-entity-field pane-node-body\" id=\"#speakable\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"><p><strong>A new study has found that no country meets the needs of its people in an environmentally sustainable way, begging the question: is this even possible?</strong></p><p>In October 2011, the world\u2019s population hit seven billion: double the number of people on Earth just 50 years before.

We call them pulsars because, if that beam along the magnetic field hits us, we often see pulses of light or x-rays or even gamma rays timed to the rotation of that neutron star\u201d explained Prof. Jordan Goodman of the University of Maryland, who is a spokesperson for the HAWC collaboration.</p><p>\u201cOne of the possible backgrounds that could be producing this excess of positrons is local sources. The most likely local sources are middle-aged, nearby pulsars. The idea is a middle-aged pulsar has been around long enough to send its electrons and positrons to the vicinity of earth. These two objects that we\u2019ve seen are two of the nearby pulsars that have been the prime suspects for this positron excess...\"</p><p>When radiation from space enters our atmosphere it creates a shower of particles, with sometimes a million particles cascading to the ground. HAWC \u2013 the High Altitude Water-Cherenkov Gamma Ray Observatory in Mexico \u2013 detects these particles using an array of 300 tanks, each holding almost 200,000 litres of water. These tanks are known as water-Cherenkov detectors and are used to observe flashes of light \u2013 known as Cherenkov radiation \u2013 that are emitted by particles when moving through a medium, such as air or water, faster than light is able to travel in that medium.\u00a0 HAWC uses measurements from each detector to build a picture of what\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about how we reconstruct the direction a particle came from, it\u2019s like if you put your hand on the keyboard of your computer. If you touched all of the keys at the same time you\u2019d know your hand was going straight down. If you came in from the PLM side you\u2019d know it was coming in from the right or the AQZ side you\u2019d know it was coming in from the left first - you can tell the arrival direction of your hand. That\u2019s what we do with our showers, we point them back into space based on the arrival time of the light in the water across these 300 detectors.\u201d</p><p>HAWC has been able to observe radiation from the two pulsars and use a simple model to show that it\u2019s very unlikely the neutron stars could produce positrons able to reach Earth and account for the excess.\u00a0 As Goodman puts it: \"we haven\u2019t ruled out that they\u2019re not the cause, we\u2019ve just given them a good alibi.\u201d This could mean the excess positrons are related to dark matter, and may in the future help us to understand this mysterious part of our Universe.</p><p>\u00a0</p></p></div></div></div></div></div>", "<div class=\"panel-separator\"></div>", "<div class=\"panel-pane pane-block pane-adsense-managed-2 pane-adsense-managed responsive width-728\"><div class=\"pane-content\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script>\n<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1388850083651616\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-ad-slot=\"5646730519\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\" style=\"display:block\"></ins>\n<script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script>\n</div></div></div></div>"]
